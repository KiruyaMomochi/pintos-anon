We didn't declare any new struct or variable in this part.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do

>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

Add the arguments downward, then add their addresses from the first
one to the last. Push the address of argv and argc representing the
length of argv[] at the end of the stack.

We use a stack so it will "just in right order". The limitaion is 
that

1. We need to push argument strings in reverse order.
2. We cannot control the size of the stack easily, however, if the
   stack overflows, `magic` number in `struct thread' will be
   corrupted and we get kernel panic.

           SYSTEM CALLS
           ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

> In `process.h`

```cpp
struct process
{
  struct thread *thread;
  char name[16];

  pid_t pid;     /* Process Id */
  int exit_code; /* Exit status. */

  struct file **fd_table; /* File descriptor table. */
  int fd_count;           /* Number of open files. */

  struct process *parent;      /* Parent process. */
  struct list chilren;         /* List of child processes. */
  struct list_elem child_elem; /* List element for children list. */

  bool load_success; /* Whether the process was loaded successfully. */
  struct semaphore load_sema; /* Semaphore for loading. */
  struct semaphore wait_sema; /* Semaphore for waiting. */
  struct semaphore exit_sema; /* Semaphore for exiting. */

  struct file *executable; /* Executable file. */
};
```

This struct defines a process control block (PCB). It contains the
information about a process, including its thread, name, PID, exit
status, file descriptor table, number of open files, parent process,
children list, whether the process was loaded successfully, loading
semaphore, waiting semaphore, and exiting semaphore. It also contains
the executable file to keep it open and deny write.

> In `thread.h`

```cpp
struct thread
{
  /* Owned by thread.c. */
  tid_t tid;                 /* Thread identifier. */
  enum thread_status status; /* Thread state. */
  char name[16];             /* Name (for debugging purposes). */
  uint8_t *stack;            /* Saved stack pointer. */
  int priority;              /* Priority. */
  struct list_elem allelem;  /* List element for all threads list. */

  /* Shared between thread.c and synch.c. */
  struct list_elem elem; /* List element. */

#ifdef USERPROG
  /* Owned by userprog/process.c. */
  uint32_t *pagedir; /* Page directory. */
+ struct process *process;
#endif

  /* Owned by thread.c. */
  unsigned magic; /* Detects stack overflow. */
};
```

Add the thread's corresponding process. 

> In `syscall.h`

```cpp
/* Size of bytes to write one time. */
#define WRITE_BUF_SIZE 512
```

It saves the size of bytes to write one time. As described in the
documentation of `write()`, we write one time `WRITE_BUF_SIZE` bytes
to console.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

We use a dynamic array to record file pointer.

This array is unique within a single process, and increase automatically
when a new file is opened.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

First we create a empty user page mapped to a kernel page.

Allocate a new empty kernel page in kernel, and set it mapped with its
according user page in user memory. If successfully mapped, set esp to
target at the physical memory so that kernel can access user memory by
access user's interrupt frame.

Then we load the arguments into intr_frame's stack, according to the 
ARGUMENT PASSING algorithm. After doing this, we are ready to read/write.
If the arguments syscall read/write, the kernel check the interrupt
frame's stack pointer. If exists, check read/write mode. If 0(Read)/1(Write), 
representing standard io, get the arguments into buffer. Otherwise get from
file f, located by fp, and read/write from file.

> For a full page: 

the least number is 1 (page's head). The page may not be contigous
when allocating. If not contigous, the greatest possible num may 
be 4096. Because it requires us to check every address to be valid 
in page. If contigous, just check 2 num is enough. First get a 
address in page,then we can check the head of this page since this
is contigous. Then we know the page is mapped into user space.

> For a 2 bytes page:

Least number is still 1.
Whatever it is contigous or not, the greatest number is 2. Since we 
only gets 2 bytes. But for kernel, since we only know where the head
of page is, still need to check second address.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

Every call for wait by a process `sema_down()` its `wait_sema`.
When this process is scheduled to run again and is dying,
store `exit_code` and wake other process. Wait to be woken up again
(time to die). Then wake other process and return exit_code.

We implement two check: `check_string` and `check_sp_and_arg`. 
By checking the address of each elements in user stack, we ensure 
arguments and string are loaded successfully into user stack. Every
time we syscall, handler will first check the `sp`'s value to determine
which syscall is called.

Suppose we syscall write. The syscall interrupt frame has load the
`esp`. And from `esp` we know it's `write()` syscall. Then we can
have the length of arguments, and get the arguments from `*(sp + 1)`,
`*(sp + 2)`, `*(sp + 3)`, etc.

For this `write()` syscall, we also check if file fd is invalid.
If invalid, this syscall can't be executed. And exit with code `-1`.

The buffer will be check by file system when read/write.
Then we just check if loading argv succeed and if the file exists in
our file descripter. Other syscall are similar. If involved reading
string, check address in user stack. If involved file operations,
check if file exists.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

We wake other processes and sleep this process.
If this process is still woken up, return PID_ERRORs.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

We ensure no race condition between P and C by using semaphore
multiple times like a barrier.

| P                             | C                              |
| sema_down (&c->wait_sema);    | sema_up (&c->wait_sema);       |
| get C's exit code;            |                                |
| sema_up (&c->exit_sema);      | sema_down (&c->exit_sema);     |
|                               | remove from P's list           |
|                               | close all opened files         |
|                               | free resources                 |
| sema_down (&c->wait_sema);    | sema_up (&c->wait_sema);       |
| sema_up (&c->exit_sema);      | sema_down (&c->exit_sema);     |
|                               | free process                   |

When a process with parent exits, it try to wake parent and then
sleep, waiting for being waken by parent again. When child process up
again, delete itself from child_list and free its file descripters
and its pointers to parent. Then parent processes finish it's wait.
This ensures no process will terminate until all resources has
been freed.

Also, child process should check if parent has exited. If true,
it does not need to wait.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

We get page address from user's intr_frame and then get data from this
address. This method is used only when system calls. 

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

Advantage: efficient to fetch every files' address.
Disadvantage: frequent memory allocation, may waste a large amount of memory.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We did not change, a tid represent a pid.
We can implement `pid_to_tid` and `tid_to_pid` to implement a more
advanced mapping.

         SURVEY QUESTIONS
         ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

It's fine.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

Yes. By implementing syscall handler, we have better understanding of
why OS is designed like this.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

In "3.3.5 Denying Writes to Executables", we should give user hint that

1. `file_deny_write()` and `file_allow_write()` are for `struct file*`.
2. The file is denying write as long as it's open by at least one 
   `struct file*` with `deny_write`.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

No for now.

>> Any other comments?

No.
